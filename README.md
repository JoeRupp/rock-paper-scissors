 - Selecting a pigeon champion starts a battle between the user and computer enemy. The selection view will disappear temporarily to show the battlefield view. In the battlefield view, the user and enemy's champion choices will be displayed along with a message saying "You Won!", "You Lost!", or "Tied!". After the winner has been declared, the selection view will be automatically displayed again.

 - Depending on who wins the round, the score will be updated in the player's info box located in the top left side, or the enemy's info box located in the top right. The user can also change their icon by clicking the `Change Bird` button located below their info. There are three icon options to pick from!

### Application Forecast
In the future, we are looking to add the following features:

1. Add sounds so that when a user hovers/clicks a button, or pigeons battle, a small sound plays.
2. Create an input allowing the user to create their own username before starting a game.
3. Add small animations to pigeons during battle view.
