### Instructions
 - When the game loads, the user will have two game modes to choose from - classic or extreme. Classic mode has three pigeon champions to pick from, while extreme adds to the complexity and has five champions. The user can toggle between the two modes without losing their current score.
 - Selecting a game mode changes the page's view to show the champion options for the user to select. The user can direct back to the game mode options by clicking the `Change Game` button in the bottom left corner.
 - Selecting a pigeon champion starts a battle between the user and computer enemy. The selection view will disappear temporarily to show the battlefield view. In the battlefield view, the user and enemy's champion choices will be displayed along with a message saying "You Won!", "You Lost!", or "Tied!". After the winner has been declared, the selection view will be automatically displayed again.
 - Depending on who wins the round, the score will be updated in the player's info box located in the top left side, or the enemy's info box located in the top right. The user can also change their icon by clicking the `Change Bird` button located below their info. There are three icon options to pick from!
 - As long as the user or enemy score is above 0, at any point the user can choose to reset the scores to 0 using the `Reset Score` button located in the bottom left corner.

### Application Forecast
In the future, we are looking to add the following features:

1. Add sounds so that when a user hovers/clicks a button, or pigeons battle, a small sound plays.
2. Create an input allowing the user to create their own username before starting a game.
3. Add small animations to pigeons during battle view.
